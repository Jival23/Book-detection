# Book Detection Keras Model

## Project Information

This project was done as part of the software engineering course EPE 321 at University of Pretoria. The project files include:
* Code used to train the model
* Code used to test the model
* Folder containing working models
* Folder containing 276 validation images to test performance of the model

Each trained model was developed using transfer learning. The output layer weights of the MobileNet and MobileNetV2 models were retrained using around 1200 images.
